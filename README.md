### Hi Geeks!

About Me

![](img.png)

Thanks for your interest, here is a quick story of me and this website.

Sandeep Jain An IIT Roorkee alumnus and founder of GeeksforGeeks. He loves to solve programming problems in most efficient ways. Apart from GeeksforGeeks, he has worked with DE Shaw and Co. as a software developer and JIIT Noida as an assistant professor.

I do my work mainly in C-Language, C++ and JAVA. C++ and Data Structure and Algorithm are my stronger section. Besides these I know Web Development, LINUX and database as well.

* * *

This website is basically one of my Web Development project which is built using HTML only. Here one can also find ideas for projects in different languages. Thanks again for reading this, because of people like you, it exists and prospers!
